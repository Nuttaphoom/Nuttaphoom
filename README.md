### While I am primarily seeking freelance or part-time opportunities in Unity development, I am open to considering other job offers as well. Please feel free to email me with any potential opportunities. Although I am currently living in Thailand, if you are genuinely interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out. We may be able to find a way to work together despite the distance.

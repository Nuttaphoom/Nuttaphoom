### Hi Everyone ! I'm Nuttaphoom Boonmee, but you can call me Arm. I grew up in Phichit, a small village in Thailand, where I developed a love for video games from a young age. I am currently on my third years studying Creative Technology at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT).
